# Quizish
A flashcard app for Android using Google Firebase. Inspired by Quizlet, this app allows you to create decks of flashcards 
in order to easily study from. You can then always go back and edit/delete your decks. Using Firebase Database and Authentecation,
users can view all user created decks and like their favorites.

#### Important Note: The code posted is not connected to the offical Quizish database. In order to set up the project to connect to your own Firebase Database, get your [SHA fingerprint](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) and [set up your own Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup#manually_add_firebase) to create your own database.
